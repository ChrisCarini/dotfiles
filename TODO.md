## Summary

Below is a list of things I would like this repository to do / accomplish, but currently does not.

If you have suggestions or advice on any of these (or anything in this repository for that matter), please let me know!

## To-Do

1) IntelliJ Customizations

1) Outlook / O365 Customizations
    1) Set O365 (outlook) "mark as read after x seconds" automagically
    1) Set O365 to show BCC by default
