## Summary

Below is a list of things I would like this repository to do / accomplish, but currently does not.

If you have suggestions or advice on any of these (or anything in this repository for that matter), please let me know!

## To-Do

1) IntelliJ Customizations
    1) Install work IJ
    1) Automatically configure IJ to point to settings repository -> https://github.com/ChrisCarini/jetbrains-settings-repository
1) Chrome Customizations
    1) Install work userscripts to Chrome + Tampermonkey
    1) Automatically install TamperMonkey for Chrome
    1) Automatically register user-scripts with Chrome

    1) Show volume in menu bar
    1) Install YubiSwitch
1) Script SSH keygen + upload to servers
1) Outlook / O365 Customizations
    1) Set O365 (outlook) "mark as read after x seconds" automagically
    1) Set O365 to show BCC by default
1) See if git-config includes conditional includes is useful (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_includes) - from https://stackoverflow.com/a/43884702
