# TODO
## Summary
Below, you will thing a list of things I would like this repository to do / accomplish, but currently does not. If you have suggestions or advice on any of these (or anything in this repository for that matter), please let me know!


## To-Do
1) Change background to Light Orb
1) Install work IJ
1) Automatically install IJ plugins (maybe not possible?)
1) Script SSH keygen + upload to servers
1) Set O365 (outlook) "mark as read after x seconds" automagically
1) Set O365 to show BCC by default
1) Install YubiSwitch
1) Bootstrap work code / projects via checkouts
1) Install work userscripts to Chrome + Tampermonkey
1) See if git-config includes conditional includes is useful (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_includes) - from https://stackoverflow.com/a/43884702
1) Automatically install TamperMonkey for Chrome
1) Automatically register user-scripts with Chrome
1) Automatically setup the `.ssh/config` file as desired.
1) Add bit about installing isort -> `shiv isort -c isort -o ~/bin/isort` or `python3 -m pip install --user isort` also works if you have `~/.local/bin` in your path (From Loren)
