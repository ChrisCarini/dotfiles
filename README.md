## Description
These are my dotfiles. Use at your own risk.

These are primarily used on Mac OS systems, but might be able to be used on Linux as well.

## Features
### Mac OS Specifics
These dotfiles allow the following Mac OS specific dotfiles to be sourced after all other supported dotfiles:
1. `.path.macos`
1. `.env.macos`
1. `.alias.macos`
1. `.functions.macos`

### Work Specific dotfiles
This repository allows the creation and use of work-specific dotfiles. Everything is contained under the `$DOTFILES_DIR/work/` directory (which is ignored by this repository). This allows for the two repositories to be maintained individually.

Similar to the structure of this repository, we allow for the following folders:
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/work/README.md`
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/work/git`
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/work/system`

#### Work `dotfiles` Initialization
To initialize the dotfiles that can be used in these directories, you can simply run:
```bash
source ~/dotfiles/bin/create_work_dotfiles.sh
```

#### Nuances
The below files will be prefered over the ones contained within this repository.
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/work/git/.gitconfig`
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/work/git/.gitignore_global`

### Banners
##### How does the banner work?
The banners file(s) need to set the variable `BANNER_OUTPUT`.

Upon sourcing all of the `.banner` files, this variable is printed via:
 ```bash 
printf "$BANNER_OUTPUT"
 ```
##### Banner dotfiles Sourcing Hierarchy
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/system/.banner`
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/system/.banner_*`
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/work/system/.banner`
1. `$DOTFILES_DIR/work/system/.banner`
 
##### Why did I chose to have the banner work this way?
Very simply, because I wanted a different banner for my work environment than my personal. The current implementation allows this in a fairly trivial manner.


### The `dotfiles` command
```bash
$ dotfiles help

Additionally, the [dotfiles community](https://dotfiles.github.io) happens to have a **TON** of great examples of other peoples `dotfiles`.
